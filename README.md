# cookie-clicker
For this project, I was tasked with creating a cookie-clicker game that utilizes the DOM. I started with a basic setup where every click on the cookie added to the counter. 

Next, I focused on styling the page to my liking. I added a background image and a cookie image, and I implemented a feature where the cookie would transform and shrink in size each time it was clicked.

After consulting with my tech lead about additional features, I decided to enhance the game. One major addition was a cookie shop. Once players reached a certain number of clicks, they could purchase different types of cookies. This would deduct the price of the new cookie from their total clicks and change the cookie displayed on the screen to the one they purchased.

I also added a restart button that resets the click count to zero and returns the cookie to its original form. Once I established the structure for these features, I styled the cookie shop to improve its appearance. I made it so that when players had enough clicks to buy a cookie, that button would highlight itself. Additionally, I implemented a feature where a popup would appear showing the cookie purchased, which lasts for two seconds before disappearing. If players did not have enough clicks, a message would display indicating how many clicks were needed to make the purchase.

Lastly, I added a random number generator that selects a decimal number between 0 and 1. If that number is equal to or less than one, the game resets. 

To understand the syntax and functionality of some styling and JavaScript elements, I utilized resources such as Stack Overflow, W3Schools, and ChatGPT.
